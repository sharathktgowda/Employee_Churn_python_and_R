# Employee_Churn_python_and_R

Inthis project, the area considered for review is HR businessanalytics, with the key topic of concern being predicting em-ployee attrition. The project is attributed towards predictingthe features responsible for employee turnover using machinelearning algorithms. The research analysis is carried out using”IBM HR Data”.Previous studies in the area are reviewed togain a better understanding of the relevant techniques andmain features.To comprehend patterns, emerging trends, andrelationships between variables, the exploration of key featuresfor attrition from the dataset is carried out using visualizationssuch as bar plots, scatter plots, distribution plots, pie charts, andso on. Machine Learning algorithm being employed in the projectis Random Forest. The model was evaluated using confusionmatrix and accuracy was found to be 86.62%.
